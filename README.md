# What is DataWorks!

FASEB DataWorks! is a new initiative that brings the biological and biomedical research communities together to advance human health through data sharing and reuse. The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, [FASEB](https://faseb.org), is a nonprofit federation of 30 biological and biomedical science societies, representing over 130,000 researchers. Over the last decade, FASEB has been working with its member societies to enhance research transparency, rigor, and reproducibility. FASEB DataWorks! comes directly from these community efforts, and aims to drive a vision of a world where all researchers reuse data. DataWorks! is designed to be open and self-sustaining and is initially funded by a US$1.5m investment by the FASEB Board.

# DataWorks! programs: Conversation Spaces, Training, Peer Support, and Prizes

Culture change is complex work. Building a social fabric to support and recognize researchers for sharing and reusing data is a long term investment. To ensure we are providing what the community needs and that we evolve as the culture changes, FASEB is taking an incremental approach. We are launching DataWorks! program pilots over the next 12 months, the first of which are the Salons (October 2021), followed by a Community program (January 2022), a Prize program (2022), and a Help Desk (2022-23).

# Why FASEB?

FASEB is uniquely positioned for this work. As a federation, we have the scope and experience to engage across our member societies on cross-cutting topics, of which data sharing and reuse is an excellent example. We are skilled at creating conversation spaces and willing to experiment with new strategies to advance health and well-being. We promote research and education in biological and biomedical sciences. And, we bring over 100 years of coalition building as a respected collaborative community advocate and voice of the researcher.

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space. FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond. We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding to support the Community and Prize programs.
